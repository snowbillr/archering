next up:
- level builder

clean up:
- what should the hitbox plugin return from `addHitbox`?
- how should hitboxes be accessed?

bugs:
- click zones on level select screen aren't quite accurate
- better "target score" calculation for results. (targets - arrows?)
- if you start holding down the mouse when an arrow is still flashing, it gets stuck at 0 charge for the next shot
