clean up:
- destroy or reuse notify texts

bugs:
- camera shouldn't scroll one pixel to the left at rest on far left of screen

ideas:
  - hitting "enemies" gives you gold (different amounts for each enemy)
  - can buy skill charges with gold
  - can unlock skills and skill upgrades with stars
  - possible skills:
    - splitting an arrow into 2 or 3 midflight
    - dropping a "bomb" from an arrow midflight
    - arrow going through multiple targets
