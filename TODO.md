current:
- keyboard shortcuts for skills

next up:
- level builder
- hitbox plugin
  - circle shape
  - take scale into account
- tutorial
- hud update
  - background/graphics
  - slots for skills
- "enemy" types
  - deer running away
  - vertical osciallation (animation of helpers turning a lever?)
  - targets hanging from balloons (when balloon goes away the target falls to the ground)
  - horizontal target laying on ground

clean up:
- destroy or reuse notify texts

bugs:
- should not be able to click anywhere on hud and fire arrow (e.g. disabled skill button)

ideas:
  - should targets and arrows disappear when they are hit/used up?
  - hitting "enemies" gives you gold (different amounts for each enemy)
  - can buy skill charges with gold
  - can unlock skills and skill upgrades with stars
  - possible skills:
    - splitting an arrow into 2 or 3 midflight
    - dropping a "bomb" from an arrow midflight
    - arrow going through multiple targets
  - gold icon should change depending on how much gold you have
