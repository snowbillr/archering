next up:
- level builder
- hitbox plugin
  - circle shape
  - take scale into account
- tutorial
- hud update
  - background/graphics
  - slots for skills
- "enemy" types
  - deer running away
  - vertical osciallation (animation of helpers turning a lever?)
  - targets hanging from balloons
- gold
  - get gold for hitting targets/bullseyes/balloons
  - don't apply earned gold until the end of the level (i.e. it shouldn't apply when restarting a level) (but the displayed total should still increase)

clean up:
- destroy or reuse notify texts

bugs:

ideas:
  - hits charge up skill meter, when skill meter is full enough you can use a skill
    - alternatively, hits don't charge up a skill meter but give you gold. and you can use gold to buy charges for each skill in a store
  - bullseyes, balloons, targets all charge skill meter (or gold amount) different amounts
  - possible skills:
    - splitting an arrow into 2 or 3 midflight
    - dropping a "bomb" from an arrow midflight
    - arrow going through multiple targets
