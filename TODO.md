bugs:

ideas:
  - hits charge up skill meter, when skill meter is full enough you can use a skill
    - alternatively, hits don't charge up a skill meter but give you gold. and you can use gold to buy charges for each skill in a store
  - bullseyes, balloons, targets all charge skill meter (or gold amount) different amounts
  - possible skills:
    - splitting an arrow into 3 midflight
    - dropping a "bomb" from an arrow midflight
    - arrow going through multiple targets
